    <h1>TIME TRAVEL EXPLAINED</h1>
    <img  src="images/time-travel.jpg" alt="Time Travel">
    <h2>Is time travel even possible?</h2>
    <p>This is a topic that many would not dare talk about. Would you believe me
      if I told you it is, in theory, "possible" to travel into the future? Sounds
      crazy huh!
    </p>
    <p>You will have to take note of the following before I explain this interesting
      fact to you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Time</li>
      <li>Mass</li>
      <li>Speed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Theoretical explanation about time travel into the future</h2>
    <p>First of all you would have to travel at "almost" the speed of light since
      it is impractical to travel at the speed of light due to the equation of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence">Mass-
      Energy Equivalence</a>. Here comes the interesting part. If you were able to travel
      at, say 90% the speed of light, then you would experience a slowing in time. For
      every ten minutes you experience, a stationery person will experience twenty
      minutes! Your time will be cut into half!<br>Therefore when you finally come to
      a stop you will have in a way travelled into the future! Imagine spending ten years
      travelling at 90% the speed of light. The rest of the people will have aged twenty
      years, ten more than you! Time travel into the future, right? Haha!
    </p>
    <p>Three things though:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Where will you find a vessel capable of propelling you that fast?</li>
      <li>Where will you be going to if at all you get that vessel?</li>
      <li>Will you ever come back?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>They say anything is posssible, right? Well let's wait and see if this will
      ever be achieved. Maybe our great, great grandchildren will... haha!
    </p>
    <p>Movies have fictional ways of explaining time travel which I wouldn't dare explore.
