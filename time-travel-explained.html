    <h1>Time Travel Explained</h1>
    <h2>Is time travel even possible?</h2>
    <p>This is a topic that many would not dare talk about. Would you believe me
      if I told you it is, in theory, "possible" to travel into the future? Sounds
      crazy huh!
    </p>
    <p>You will have to take note of the following before I explain this interesting
      fact to you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Time</li>
      <li>Mass</li>
      <li>Speed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Theoretical explanation about time travel into the future</h2>
    <p>First of all you would have to travel at "almost" the speed of light since
      it is impractical to travel at the speed of light due to the equation of mass-
      energy equivalence. Here comes the interesting part. If you were able to travel
      at, say 90% the speed of light, then you would experience a slowing in time. For
      every ten minutes you experience, a stationery person will experience twenty
      minutes! Your time will be cut into half!<br>Therefore when you finally come to
      a stop you will have in a way travelled into the future! Imagine spending ten years
      travelling at 90% the speed of light. The rest of the people will have aged twenty
      years, ten more than you! Time travel into the future, right? Haha!
    </p>
    <p>Three things though:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Where will you find a vessel capable of propelling you that fast?</li>
      <li>Where will you be going to if at all you get that vessel?</li>
      <li>Will you ever come back?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>They say anything is posssible, right? Well let's wait and see if this will
      ever be achieved. Maybe our great, great grandchildren will... haha!
